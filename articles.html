              <p><strong>Futsal is a Soccer-based sport that is usually played indoors instead of a large field.</strong> The smaller field size ensures a game that is intense and fast-paced, with more opportunity for goal scoring. It is played by two teams of five players each, one of whom serves as the goalie <strong>MingTeng's, particularly the Dayangdang branch, participated in the recently held futsal tournament at Magarao Convention center last December 3, 2023.</strong> Magarao is a third-class municipality in the Philippine province of Camarines Sur, formally known as the Municipality of Magarao. 26,742 people reside there, according to the 2020 census. Magarao is also a part of the Metro Naga Urban Area.

              <strong>MingTeng's believe that participating in sports tournaments holds paramount importance in fostering personal development, teamwork, and a healthy lifestyle.</strong> Beyond the thrill of competition, these tournaments provide individuals with opportunities to enhance their physical fitness, hone their skills, and test their limits. The experience of joining a sports tournament instills a sense of discipline, resilience, and strategic thinking, qualities that extend far beyond the playing field. Moreover, tournaments serve as a platform for building camaraderie and teamwork, as athletes collaborate towards a common goal, learn to trust one another, and celebrate victories together. <strong>The competitive nature of tournaments also teaches valuable lessons in handling success and setbacks gracefully, promoting character development and sportsmanship.</strong> Whether for amateurs or seasoned athletes, the journey through a sports tournament is a powerful avenue for personal growth, self-discovery, and the cultivation of a lifelong passion for a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>

              <p><strong>JVF (Junior Varsity Football) is a sports tournament intended for encouraging the youth in participating in a friendly football competetion.</strong> Although upperclassmen may occasionally play on JV teams, most junior varsity teams are made up of players in their freshman and sophomore years of school. Because of this, junior varsity teams are sometimes referred to as freshman or sophomore teams. The level of intensity on these teams varies depending on the field they play on.
              <br><br>
              <strong>MingTeng's believe that Encouraging the youth in junior varsity football is an investment in their physical well-being, character development, and the formation of lifelong skills.</strong> The JV football experience is not merely about the score on the scoreboard; it's a journey that instills values such as discipline, perseverance, and teamwork. <strong>Coaches and mentors play a crucial role in fostering a positive environment, emphasizing the importance of effort, improvement, and camaraderie over mere victory.</strong> The junior varsity stage serves as a vital stepping stone where young athletes can refine their skills, discover their strengths, and learn how to overcome challenges on and off the field. Emphasizing a growth mindset and celebrating individual progress can inspire a sense of confidence that extends beyond the football field into various aspects of their lives. Encouraging these aspiring players not only nurtures their athletic potential but also molds them into resilient, goal-oriented individuals who will carry the lessons learned on the JV football field into their future endeavors.
              <br><br>
              <strong>That is why MingTeng's decided to organize a friendly JVF tournament to engage the youth in activities that nurture desirable qualities and lifelong skills.</strong> MingTeng's JVF Cup was comprised of 5 categories, Namely: players "Born on 2011 (mixed)" with FREE registration, "Born on 2009 (boys)" with a registration fee of 1000 pesos, "Born on 2009 (girls)" with a registration fee of 1000 pesos, "Born on 2007 (boys)" with a registration fee of 1000 pesos, "Born on 2007 (girls)" with a registration fee of 1000 pesos, "men's open" with a registration fee of 1500 pesos, and "women's open" with a registration fee of 1500 pesos.</p>
